...my humble beginnings.


...it's been quite a ride, and I'm just the simple traveller. On this grand course of life this is a huge leap on my journey to becoming a developer/programmer. It's been a lot of studies, analysis, and experimenting. I figured out something about life, and it's in the secret of processes _you must follow through.
  
  Take some elevated stance and you'll realize that it's not a race _life. Though there are no speed limits, the warning, "speed kills!", isn't just for the drivers and vehicle operators, you'll be surprised how much of pedestrians die from the trespassing.
  
  Life is only a journey in the mind, and we all are doing our walk.
